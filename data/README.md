# Data resources

All data files (documents, images, etc.) used for local testing and development
should be be placed in this folder and its subfolders. The suggested 
organization is as follows:

- **documents** - PDF document files
- **signatures** - SVG/PNG images of signatures

Files in these directories will automatically be ignored by Git.
